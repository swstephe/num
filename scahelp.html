      The
      <a href="sca2.html">Sound Change Applier 2</a>
      is an updated version of
      <a href="sounds.htm">my C program</a>
      which applies a set of sound changes to a lexicon.
      You can use it to help work out a <b>reconstruction</b> for actual
      languages, to create plausible descendants of a <b>conlang</b>,
      or in fact to make any structured set of lexical changes to a
      database of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      This version is written in <b>Javascript</b>, which means it runs in
      your browser.  The advantage is that it supports Unicode,
      it'll run on all systems, and you don't have to mess with ASCII or
      command lines anymore.
    </p>
    <p><a href="#new">Changes since the old SCA</a>.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
      Try it out!  With the default inputs, hit <b>Apply</b>.
      You should get an output like this:

      <blockquote>
        <pre>
<tt>leitor</tt>
<tt>doutor</tt>
<tt>fogo</tt>
<tt>jogo</tt>
<tt>distrito</tt>
<tt>cidade</tt>
<tt>adotar</tt>
<tt>obra</tt>
<tt>segundo</tt>
        </pre>
      </blockquote>

      As if by magic, a selection of Latin words has turned into Portuguese. 

    <h3>The controls</h3>

    Here's what the controls do.

    <p>
      <b>Output format</b>
      tells how you want each line of the output to look like.
      The first option just prints each output word; this is good for
      generating a new list of words (e.g. as input for the next round of
      changes).  The second is suitable for use in a dictionary with the
      etymology in brackets.   The third gives the input and output words in
      order. (<a href="#gloss">See here</a> for how to add glosses.)

    <p>
      <b>Show differences from last run</b>,
      if checked, will
      <b>boldface</b>
      any changes from the last run when you hit Apply.
      This can be very useful to see what the effect of a changed rule is.
      (Try it with the defaults: change <tt>[sm]//_#</tt>
      in the first sound change to <tt>[m]//_#</tt> and hit Apply.
      You should see several of the words change, now retaining their final s.)

    <p>
      The comparison is very simple-minded; in particular it can't keep track
      of added or deleted lines in the lexicon.

    <p>
      Note that if you hit Apply without making any changes, all the bolding
      is removed (since in fact nothing changed between runs).

    <p>
      <b>Report which rules apply</b>
      prints a report in the Output section listing every time a rule applies,
      like this:

      <blockquote><tt>u/o/_# applies to districtu at 8</tt></blockquote>

      This is useful for understanding why a rule applies (or doesn't) when
      you expected the opposite.  

    <p>
      <b>Rewrite on output</b>
      controls whether the <a href="#rr">rewrite rules</a> should be reversed
      when writing the output lexicon.

    <p>
      <b>Apply</b>
      applies the sound changes to the input lexicon, generating the output
      lexicon.  We'll talk about exactly what that means below. 

    <p>
      Javascript, to protect your computer, cannot read or write
      <b>files</b>.  Instead:

      <ul>
        <li>To <b>save a file</b>, hit <b>Back to .sc</b>, copy the text in
        the Sound Changes box, and save it yourself in Notepad or whatever.
        <li>To <b>read in a file</b>, grab the text from Notepad and paste it
        into the Sound Changes box.  Then hit <b>Parse .sc</b> to move the
        lines into the appropriate boxes.  (Comments, meaning anything the
        program can't recognize, stay in the Sound Changes box.)
      </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Help me!</b> brings up this help file.

    <p>
      <b>IPA</b> will post a set of IPA and other useful Unicode characters
      to the Output area.  You can then copy and paste a character into any
      of the input boxes.

    <p>On Safari and Firefox, <b>Undo</b> will work as it should: you can make
      a change, hit Apply, and if you don't like the results, click on the text
      box you changed and select Undo.  This doesn't work on IE. 

    <h3>Defining sound changes</h3>

    The Sound Changes box are rules for modifying the input lexicon.

    Hopefully the format of the rules will be familiar to any linguist.
    For instance, here's one sound change:

    <blockquote><tt>c/g/V_V</tt></blockquote>

    This rule says to change <tt>c</tt> to <tt>g</tt> between vowels.
    (We'll see how to generalize this rule below.)

    <p>More generally, a sound change looks like this: 

    <blockquote>
    <font color="#C08700"><i><b>target/replacement/environment</b></i></font>
    </blockquote>

    that is, the target string is changed to the replacement string within
    the given environment.

    <p>Optionally you can use &rarr; in place of the first slash.  So the
    above rule can also be written

    <blockquote><tt>c&rarr;g/V_V</tt></blockquote>

    <p>The environment must always contain an underline <tt>_</tt>,
    representing the part that changes.  That can be all there is, as in 

    <blockquote><tt>gn/nh/_ </tt><br></blockquote>

    which tells the program to replace <tt>gn</tt> with <tt>nh</tt>
    unconditionally.

    <p>The character <tt>#</tt> represents the <b>beginning or end</b>
    of the word.  So

    <blockquote><tt>u/o/_#</tt></blockquote>

    means to replace <tt>u</tt> with <tt>o</tt>, but only at the end of
    the word.

    <p>The replacement string can be <b>blank</b>, as in

      <blockquote><tt>s//_#</tt></blockquote>

      This means that <tt>s</tt> is <b>deleted</b> when it ends a word.

    <h4>Categories</h4>

    <p>
      The environment can contain <b>variables</b>, like <tt>V</tt> above.  
      These are defined in the Categories box.  I use capital letters for this,
      though this is not a requirement.  Variables can only be one character
      long (unless you use <a href="#rr">rewrite rules</a>).

      You can define any variables needed to state your sound changes.
      E.g. you could define <tt>S</tt> to be any stop, or <tt>K</tt>
      for any coronal, or whatever.

    <p>So the category definition and rule

    <blockquote><tt>F=ie<br>c/i/F_t</tt></blockquote>

    means that <tt>c</tt> changes to <tt>i</tt> after a front vowel and before
    a <tt>t</tt>.

    <p>
      You can use variables in the first two parts as well. For instance,
      suppose you've defined

      <blockquote><tt>S=ptc<br>Z=bdg<br>S/Z/V_V</tt></blockquote>

      This means that the stops <tt>ptc</tt> change to their voiced equivalents
      <tt>bdg</tt> between vowels.  In this usage, the variables must
      correspond one for one&mdash; <tt>p</tt> goes to <tt>b</tt>,
      <tt>t</tt> goes to <tt>d</tt>, etc.  Each character in the replacement
      variable (here <tt>Z</tt>) gives the transformed value of each character
      in the input variable (here <tt>S</tt>).

      If the replacement category is shorter than the target category,
      the matching input will be deleted.
    </p>

    <p>
      A variable can also be set to a fixed value, or deleted.  E.g.

      <blockquote><tt>Z//V_V</tt></blockquote>
      says to delete voiced stops between vowels.
    </p>

    <h4>Rule order</h4>
    <p>
      Rules apply in the <b>order</b> they're listed.
      So, with the word <tt>opera</tt> and the rules

      <blockquote><tt>p/b/V_V<br>e//C_rV</tt></blockquote>

      the first rule voices the <tt>p</tt>, resulting in <tt>obera</tt>;
      the second deletes an <tt>e</tt> between a consonant and an
      intervocalic <tt>r</tt>, resulting in <tt>obra</tt>.
    </p>

    <h4>Optional elements in the environment</h4>

    <p>
      One or more elements in the environment can be marked as
      <b>optional</b> with parentheses.  E.g.

      <blockquote><tt>u/&uuml;/_C(C)F</tt></blockquote>

      says to change <tt>u</tt> to <tt>&uuml;</tt>
      when it's followed by one or two consonants and then a front vowel.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="new">New stuff</a></h3>

    In addition to Unicode support, the IPA chart, and
    <a href="#rr">rewrite rules</a>:

    <p>
      SCA&#x00b2; treats <b>spaces as word boundaries</b>.
      So if you have a rule

      <blockquote><tt>k/s/#_</tt></blockquote>

      then it will not only turn <tt>kima</tt> to <tt>sima</tt>,
      but <tt>kima kimaka</tt> to <tt>sima simaka</tt>.  

    <p>
      <b>Epenthesis</b> is supported by leaving the target part of the rule
      blank.  The replacement string must be nonblank, and the environment
      must contain at least one symbol besides <tt>_</tt>.  For instance

      <blockquote><tt>/j/_kt</tt></blockquote>

      will insert <tt>j</tt> before every instance of <tt>kt</tt>.

    <p>
      Simple <b>metathesis</b> is supported by the special replacement string
      <tt>\\</tt>.  For instance

      <blockquote><tt>nt/\\/_V</tt></blockquote>

      will turn all instances of <tt>nt</tt> before a vowel to <tt>tn</tt>.

      (To be precise, the input string is reversed; it can be of any length.)

    <p>
      <b>Nonce categories</b> can be defined either in the target
      (first part of the rule) or environment (last part), by enclosing
      the alternatives within brackets.  Examples:  

      <blockquote>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>k/s/_[ie]</tt></td>
            <td>
              Change <tt>k</tt> to <tt>s</tt> before either
              <tt>i</tt> or <tt>e</tt>.
            </td>
          </tr><tr>
            <td><tt>[ao]u/o/_</tt></td>
            <td>
              Either <tt>au</tt> or <tt>ou</tt> is changed to <tt>o</tt>.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>m/n/_[dt#]</tt></td>
            <td>
              Change <tt>m</tt> to <tt>n</tt> before dentals and word-finally.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>

       With the SCA1 I found myself writing a lot of similar rules,
       and nonce categories let them be combined.

    <p>
      Nonce categories in the environment (only) can include other categories:

      <blockquote>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>k/g/_[VL]</tt></td>
            <td>
              Change <tt>k</tt> to <tt>g</tt> before any member
              of categories <tt>V</tt> or <tt>L</tt>.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
        
    <p>
      Nonce categories in the environment can include the word boundary
      <tt>#</tt>.
        
    <p>
      <b>Degemination</b>
      can be accomplished using the special character &#x00b2;.
      (Note that this is the first character shown in the IPA display.)

      <blockquote>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>m//_&#x00b2;</tt></td>
            <td width="20px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td>Change <tt>mm</tt> to <tt>m</tt>.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>M=mn<br>M//_&#x00b2;</tt></td>
            <td width="20px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td>Change <tt>mm</tt> to <tt>m</tt> and <tt>nn</tt> to <tt>n</tt>,
            but leave <tt>mn</tt> and <tt>nm</tt> alone.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>

      Finally, SCA&#x00b2; now supports <b>extended category substitution</b>.
      The target must still begin with a category; however, other material may
      occur after it.  And the replacement string may contain any number of
      characters, with a category string given at any point.  Examples: 

      <blockquote>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>Bi/Dj/_</tt></td>
            <td width="20px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td>
              Instances of <tt>B</tt> plus <tt>i</tt> are changed to the
              corresponding member of <tt>D</tt> plus <tt>j</tt>.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>Nd/bM/_V</tt></td>
            <td width="20px">&nbsp;</td>
            <td>
              Instances of <tt>N</tt> plus <tt>d</tt> before a vowel are
              changed to <tt>b</tt> plus the corresponding member of
              <tt>M</tt>; note that this is a more complicated metathesis.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can do <b>gemination</b> on category substitution, like this:
 
      <blockquote><tt>M/M&#x00b2;/_</tt></blockquote>

      This will geminate all members of category <tt>M</tt>.

    </p>
    <p>
      You can use a special <b>wildcard</b> <tt>&#x2026;</tt> to match
      anything.  This allows you to test for something earlier or later on in
      the word.  E.g. this rule will change a member of <tt>S</tt>
      to <tt>Z</tt> if there is a vowel <tt>V</tt> <i>anywhere</i> following
      it:

      <blockquote><tt>S/Z/_&#x2026;V</tt></blockquote>

      <p>(This is a new feature and may still have bugs.)</p>

    <p>
      The <tt>&#x2026;</tt> symbol is the third character in the IPA list.
      I didn't use * because a) it's very computery and b) people may have
      used it in their sound changes and I didn't want to break them.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="gloss">Including a gloss</a></h3>

    It can be convenient to include a gloss in your lexicon which isn't
    affected by the sound changes.  This is done by separating the gloss with
    a space plus the special character &#x2023; (this is the second character
    in the text shown by the IPA button).  For instance:

    <blockquote><tt>focus &#x2023; fire</tt></blockquote>

    Here's the output you'll get from that (with the default sound changes),
    in each of the output formats:

    <blockquote>
      <tt>
        fogo &#x2023; fire<br>
        fire &rarr; fogo &#x2023; fire<br>
        fogo &#x2023; fire [focus]
      </tt>
    </blockquote>

    No sound changes will apply to anything after &#x2023;, but rewrite rules
    do apply, so if you use this option I recommend using non-English
    characters for the rewrite rules (e.g. use <tt>&#x03c7;</tt> rather than
    <tt>x</tt> for <tt>kh</tt>).

    <h3><a name="except">Rule exceptions</a></h3>

    Sometimes you'd like to say that a rule applies in environment
    e<sub>1</sub>, except for environment e<sub>2</sub>.
    You can generally handle this by writing more rules, but SCA&#x00b2;
    also allows you to state this directly by adding e<sub>2</sub>
    after another slash, e.g.

    <blockquote>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>k/s/_F/#s_</tt></td>
          <td width="20px">&nbsp;</td>
          <td>
            <tt>k</tt> changes to <tt>s</tt> before a front vowel,
            but <b>not</b> after word-initial <tt>s</tt>.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>M/N/#_/_CF</tt></td>
          <td width="20px">&nbsp;</td>
          <td>
            Category <tt>M</tt> changes to category <tt>N</tt> word initially,
            but <b>not</b> before another consonant followed by a  front vowel. 
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </blockquote>

    Because of the difficulty of lining up the <tt>_</tt> in both environments,
    the exception environment can't include optional characters (those in
    parentheses) before the underline.  (They can occur after it.)

    <h3><a name="rr">Rewrite rules</a></h3>

    These allow you to apply global substitutions to the input and output.
    The most important use is to allow <b>digraphs</b>.

    <blockquote>
      <i><font color="red">If you use digraphs, you must follow the rules
      in this section.  SCA&#x00b2; won't handle digraphs properly on
      its own.</font></i>
    </blockquote>

    Rules with diagraphs will work so long as they can be treated as
    sequences of characters.  For instance, these all work fine:

    <blockquote>
      <tt>c/ch/_a</tt>
      <br>
      <tt>sh/zh/V_V</tt>
      <br>
      <tt>u/o/_ng</tt>
    </blockquote>

    But you can't define categories with digraphs.  E.g. this was probably
    intended to define three fricatives <tt>kh sh zh</tt>

    <blockquote><tt>F=khshzh</tt></blockquote>

    but in fact it defines the F category as <tt>k h s h z h</tt>,
    which won't at all do what you expect.

    <p>
      The old SCA required that you use single characters instead.  E.g. you
      might write 

      <blockquote><tt>F=x&#x00df;&#x03a9;</tt></blockquote>

      That still works, but you can use rewrite rules instead.
      E.g. define some rules like this:

      <blockquote>
        <tt>kh|x</tt>
        <br>
        <tt>zh|&#x017e;</tt>
        <br>
        <tt>sh|&#x0161;</tt>
        <br>
        <tt>ng|&#x014b;</tt>
      </blockquote>

      Now you can use <tt>kh zh sh ng</tt> in any of the other input
      boxes&mdash; categories, sound changes, input lexicon.  The SCA will
      apply the rewrite rules to provide single characters it can work with,
      and then apply them again backwards to provide output using digraphs.

    <p>
      You could also use rewrite rules to allow longer or mnemonic names for
      your categories.  E.g. 

      <blockquote>
        <tt>&lt;front&gt;|F</tt>
      </blockquote>

      Now you could write sound changes like

      <blockquote>
        <tt>i/&uuml;/_&lt;front&gt;</tt>
      </blockquote>

      (The category names still have to be unique&mdash; you can't use
      <tt>F</tt> to define both front vowels and fricatives.  But recall
      that you can use any Unicode character now for category names.)

    <p>
      A warning though: so they operate quickly, the rewrite rules are global
      and non-contextual.  The results may surprise you if you didn't realize
      your transcription system was ambigious.  E.g. don't use <tt>kh</tt>
      both for IPA /x/ and for the cluster /k h/.  

    <p>
      If you need contextual rewrite rules... just use SCA&#x00b2;!
      Add your rewrite rules at the top and bottom of the file, with the
      appropriate context specifications.  

    <p>
      Sometimes you want the rewrite rules to apply only to the input.
      (For instance, the orthography may only apply to the parent language.)
      In that case, make sure <b>Rewrite on output</b> is unchecked.
